== DOCS!

This is a rails app (duh).  It's going to be pretty small, and is simply a way for members to notify other members of important things via text message (example:  the fire station is going to be empty for the next 3 hours, please somebody come cover it!).

Want to take this source code and build your own similar app?  Feel free.  Just please don't use the layout files as is, we purchased a single license for our website and the authorization to use it doesn't extend to you. Thanks!
